## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Changed: minds latchkey permission management now uses latchkey 2.9.0's `permission_requests` / `permissions` gateway extensions; permission requests stream via `GET /permission-requests?follow=true` and grants apply through `POST /permissions/rules`.
- Changed: minds split the services agent from the initial chat agent — the primary agent runs only bootstrap/services and is hidden; a real chat agent named after the host is created on first boot and every subsequent agent shares its `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Existing workspaces must be re-created.
- Changed: minds "Create a Project" Name field now sets the host name (validated via `HostName` regex); the agent is always `system-services`, and `imbue_cloud` `/hosts/lease` and `/hosts` gain a required `host_name`.

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Changed: minds switched to per-host latchkey state — `LatchkeyForwardInfo.gateway_port` stamped for non-spawning consumers; minds now stores per-host `latchkey_permissions.json` under `<latchkey-dir>/mngr_latchkey/hosts/<host_id>/`.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added: New `minds run` command that spawns `mngr forward` as a subprocess and consumes its JSONL envelope stream instead of running forwarding in-process.
- Added: minds injects `LATCHKEY_DISABLE_COUNTING=1` into every workspace whenever latchkey is wired so the shared host-side gateway represents one user.
- Added: minds installs a grandparent-death watcher so the Python backend self-terminates ~3 s after Electron crashes, cascading into `mngr observe` / `mngr events` / latchkey children.
- Added: New `MalformedMngrOutputError` (`imbue.minds.errors`).

### Changed

- Changed: Bumped bundled Latchkey to 2.8.0 and switched minds to a single shared `latchkey gateway` subprocess for all agents, with password-protected `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_LISTEN_PASSWORD`.
- Changed: Reverse-tunnel health check now retries broken tunnels forever (capped at one attempt per 5 minutes via exponential backoff) instead of giving up after 10 consecutive failures.
- Changed: minds "Create a Project" screen — removed the .env checkbox, added an independent "AI provider" choice, renamed "Launch mode" to "Compute provider", added an optional `GH_TOKEN` Advanced field; revoked imbue_cloud sessions auto-disable the matching provider block.
- Changed: minds no longer persists `imbue_cloud` account identity to disk; only the workspace↔account map lives on disk, identity is sourced on demand.

### Removed

- Removed: `LaunchMode.DEV` from minds — the web create form, `/create`, and `/api/create-agent` now only offer `LOCAL` / `LIMA` / `CLOUD` / `IMBUE_CLOUD`; the DEV-only latchkey helper and `MINDS_ALLOW_HOST_LOOPBACK` env var are gone.
- Removed: `apps/minds_workspace_server/` from the monorepo — migrated to `forever-claude-template`'s `apps/system_interface/` and consumed at runtime; the release Dockerfile's node/npm install step is dropped.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `minds run` no longer pegs a CPU as agents/hosts come and go — reverse-tunnel bookkeeping is pruned on agent destroy and the 30 s health-check loop applies per-tunnel exponential backoff.
- Fixed: WebSocket broadcaster queue-full flood — stuck WS clients are evicted after 50 consecutive queue-full broadcasts, and the broadcaster cancels wedged handler tasks blocked on `send_text(...)`.
- Fixed: Closing the last tab in a minds workspace no longer leaves a blank screen — the primary agent's chat tab is automatically reopened when the dockview becomes empty.
- Fixed: `apps/minds/scripts/propagate_changes` now protects `.claude/settings.local.json` from `rsync --delete`, preventing per-agent `UserPromptSubmit` hook loss and the resulting 90 s `send_message` hang.
