## minds: switch permission management to the latchkey 2.9.0 gateway extensions

Latchkey 2.9.0 ships two new gateway extensions that this branch wires
into the minds desktop client (in coordination with `mngr_latchkey`):

- `permission_requests.mjs` -- per-process pending-permission queue.
  Agents `POST /permission-requests` when they hit a blocked service;
  the desktop client consumes `GET /permission-requests?follow=true`
  to learn about new requests and `DELETE /permission-requests/<id>`
  to clear them once granted or denied.
- `permissions.mjs` -- a `permissions.json` editor that operates on any
  file path inside `LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_PERMISSIONS_ROOT`. Used by the
  desktop client to apply per-host permission grants via
  `POST /permissions/rules?path=<host_file>&rule_key=<scope>`.

### Minds desktop client

- `cli/run.py` now blocks on `_wait_for_gateway_port` (which polls
  `LatchkeyForwardInfo.gateway_port` for a non-None value) before the
  FastAPI app is built, then derives the gateway password and mints
  the admin JWT in-process and constructs a `LatchkeyGatewayClient`
  shared by every code path that talks to the gateway extensions.
- New `PermissionRequestsConsumer` daemon thread streams
  `GET /permission-requests?follow=true` and feeds each pending
  request into the existing `RequestInbox`. The legacy
  `events.jsonl` callback now ignores `LATCHKEY_PERMISSION` lines
  because the extension owns that flow; non-latchkey
  `PERMISSIONS` events still go through the JSONL channel
  unchanged.
- `LatchkeyPermissionGrantHandler` applies grants via the new
  `permissions` extension (`POST /permissions/rules?path=...&rule_key=...`)
  and clears the pending gateway record via `DELETE
  /permission-requests/<id>` on both grant and deny.
- New `gateway_client.py`, `permission_requests_consumer.py`, and
  `testing.py` modules support the above; corresponding unit-test
  files exercise the HTTP wire shape and the streaming/translation
  paths.

### Compatibility

Agents that still post `LATCHKEY_PERMISSION` request events via the
old `events.jsonl` channel will no longer reach the minds inbox.
Migrating agents to the gateway-side `POST /permission-requests`
endpoint is a follow-up.

**minds**: split the services agent from the initial chat agent. The "primary" agent in a minds workspace now runs only the bootstrap and background services (its window-0 command is `sleep infinity && claude`, so claude never actually starts) and is hidden from the agent list in the UI. On first container boot the bootstrap creates a real chat agent named after the host, sends it `/welcome`, and writes `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to the host env so every subsequent agent (chat, worktree, worker) shares the services agent's Claude config dir (auth, plugins, marketplaces, sessions). Destroying chat agents no longer tears down services, and restarting services no longer kills chat agents. The workspace_server `/api/agents/<id>/destroy` endpoint refuses to destroy `is_primary=true` agents as a server-side guard. Existing pre-change workspaces are not migrated — re-create them.

Minds: the "Name" field on the create-project form now sets the *host* name (validated via mngr's `HostName` regex), not the agent name. The agent is always called `system-services`. The imbue_cloud connector grows a required `host_name` on `/hosts/lease` and `/hosts`. Sister change in `forever-claude-template` (matching branch) drops the now-unused `MINDS_WORKSPACE_NAME` from `[commands.create].pass_env`.

# Latchkey state per-host (minds side)

When minds creates an agent, the Latchkey-related env vars
(`LATCHKEY_GATEWAY`, `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`,
`LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE`, `LATCHKEY_DISABLE_COUNTING`)
are now passed to `mngr create` via `--host-env` instead of `--env`, so
every agent that ever runs on the host shares the same gateway URL,
password, JWT, and permissions.

The on-disk permissions metadata moves accordingly: minds now stores
the per-agent `latchkey_permissions.json` under
`<latchkey-dir>/mngr_latchkey/hosts/<host_id>/` instead of
`<latchkey-dir>/mngr_latchkey/agents/<agent_id>/`. After `mngr create`
returns, minds reads the canonical `host_id` from the trailing JSONL
`created` event and points the opaque permissions handle (referenced
by the JWT minted at create time) at the new host-keyed path.

The minds UI's grant flow now resolves the request event's `agent_id`
to its `host_id` via the backend resolver before writing the grant; if
the resolver hasn't seen the agent yet (or only reports the static
`"localhost"` placeholder), the grant POST returns 503 so the UI can
retry instead of silently writing the grant to the wrong file.

### Minds-side cleanups for the mngr-latchkey package extraction

- `apps/minds/imbue/minds/desktop_client/ssh_tunnel.py`: removed the
  now-unused `SSHTunnelManager` and supporting types (`ReverseTunnelInfo`,
  `_TunnelFailureState`, `_ForwardedTunnelHandler`, relay imports,
  reverse-tunnel health-check / backoff constants, and the internal
  `_ssh_connection_*` helpers). Kept `RemoteSSHInfo`, `SSHTunnelError`,
  `open_ssh_client`, and `_create_ssh_client` -- still used by
  `backend_resolver.py`, `forward_cli.py`, and the `MindsRemoteSSHInfo`
  adapter in `cli/run.py`. The matching test files
  (`ssh_tunnel_test.py`, `test_ssh_tunnel_leak.py`) moved to the new
  package along with the manager.
- `cli/run.py` and `desktop_client/agent_creator.py` rewired to import
  the latchkey types and helpers from the plugin and wrap the
  raising plugin entry points (`prepare_agent_latchkey`,
  `finalize_agent_permissions`) in try/except blocks that log a
  warning and continue agent creation -- preserving the prior
  end-to-end behaviour where a misconfigured latchkey installation
  does not abort agent creation, but making the choice explicit at the
  call site rather than buried inside the library.
- Three minds `test_ratchets.py` snapshots tightened
  (`while_true 1->0`, `time_sleep 2->1`, `broad_exception_catch 1->0`)
  to reflect violations that went away with the deleted code.

### Minds: spawn `mngr latchkey forward` as a detached subprocess

`apps/minds/imbue/minds/cli/run.py` no longer constructs
`SSHTunnelManager` / `LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler` /
`LatchkeyDestructionHandler` in-process; it instead calls
`LatchkeyForwardSupervisor.ensure_running()` at startup, which spawns
the canonical `mngr latchkey forward` process detached. Minds does
*not* call `supervisor.stop()` on shutdown -- the supervisor keeps
running across desktop-client restarts and the next minds session
adopts it. This matches how minds already treated the underlying
`latchkey gateway` subprocess.

Side effect: the `_LatchkeyDiscoveryAdapter` class in `cli/run.py` is
gone, plus its supporting `MindsRemoteSSHInfo` / `AgentId` imports.

## 2026-05-09

- Fixed: the `minds run` process no longer pegs a CPU after agents or hosts come and go. Reverse-tunnel bookkeeping in the desktop client's `SSHTunnelManager` (used for Latchkey gateways) is now pruned when an agent is destroyed -- so paramiko transport threads can exit instead of being kept alive by repeated re-establishment attempts -- and the 30s health-check loop applies per-tunnel exponential backoff and drops a tunnel after 10 consecutive failed repair attempts.

- Changed: the desktop client's `SSHTunnelManager` reverse-tunnel health check now retries broken tunnels forever (capped at one attempt per 5 minutes via the existing exponential backoff) instead of giving up after 10 consecutive failures. This matches the user-visible expectation that going offline overnight should still result in working tunnels in the morning.

- Removed `LaunchMode.DEV` from minds. The web create form, `/create`, and
  `/api/create-agent` now offer only `LOCAL`, `LIMA`, `CLOUD`, and
  `IMBUE_CLOUD`; submitting `launch_mode=DEV` returns 400. The DEV-only
  latchkey gateway helper, the `MINDS_ALLOW_HOST_LOOPBACK` env var, and the
  `allow_host_loopback` field on `ForwardSubprocessConfig` are gone (the
  generic `mngr_forward --allow-host-loopback` CLI flag stays for
  non-minds consumers).

Companion changes live in the forever-claude-template repo on the
same-named branch (`mngr/tweak-template`): default `~/.tmux.conf`
provisioning, `--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE` for the docker template, removal of
the unused `events_processor/` project, removal of `[create_templates.dev]`,
and the crystallization Stop hook is disabled.

## 2026-05-08

Removed `apps/minds_workspace_server/` from the monorepo. The workspace server (the FastAPI + dockview UI service that runs inside each agent's container) has been migrated to forever-claude-template, where it now lives at `apps/system_interface/` and ships as the `minds-workspace-server` CLI. Consumers (the minds desktop client and mngr) pick it up at runtime from the consumer's vendored forever-claude-template checkout instead of from this repo. Build-time impact: the release Dockerfile no longer cross-references the workspace server's frontend, and the node/npm install step that existed only to build it has been dropped. The `apps/minds/scripts/propagate_changes` dev-loop script now rsyncs from `/code/apps/system_interface/frontend/` in the running agent. User-facing docs (`apps/minds/docs/overview.md`, `apps/minds/docs/workspace/getting_started.md`) and the historical specs that referenced the old path were updated.

## 2026-05-07

- minds now injects `LATCHKEY_DISABLE_COUNTING=1` into every workspace
  whenever latchkey is wired (alongside `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY`,
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`, and `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE`).
  The workspace-side `latchkey` CLI runs in client mode against the
  host-side gateway, so suppressing its daily goatcounter.com ping
  prevents every agent from being counted as a separate active user --
  the single host-side gateway already represents the one real user.

- Bumped the `latchkey` npm dependency to 2.8.0 and switched minds to
  running a single shared `latchkey gateway` subprocess for every agent
  instead of one per agent. The gateway is now password-protected via
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_LISTEN_PASSWORD` (the password is derived
  deterministically from the desktop client's Latchkey encryption key by
  hashing a JWT minted with `latchkey gateway create-jwt`, so it
  survives restarts without being persisted in plaintext).
- Each agent gets its own `latchkey_permissions.json`. At
  agent-creation time minds allocates an opaque
  `~/.minds/latchkey/permissions/<uuid>.json` handle, materializes it
  with empty rules (deny-all baseline), mints a permissions-override
  JWT for that path, and injects all three latchkey env vars
  (`LATCHKEY_GATEWAY`, `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`,
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE`) at `mngr create` time.
  After `mngr create` returns the canonical agent id, minds replaces
  the opaque file with a symlink pointing at the canonical
  `~/.minds/agents/<agent_id>/latchkey_permissions.json` location, so
  the existing permission-grant flow continues to write to its
  conventional path while the gateway reads through the symlink. The
  gateway's own default permissions config
  (`~/.minds/latchkey_default_permissions.json`) is materialized empty
  (deny-all) so requests that bypass the JWT mechanism cannot reach
  any service.
- DEV-mode agents (which run in-process on the bare host with no SSH
  reverse tunnel) now go through the same gateway as every other
  launch mode. `AgentCreator` queries the gateway's live host port
  and injects it as `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY=http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic_port>`
  alongside the password and JWT. Previously DEV agents bypassed the
  gateway entirely, which made the full latchkey flow impossible to
  exercise from DEV.
- Old per-agent gateway records left under
  `~/.minds/agents/<id>/latchkey_gateway.json` are cleaned up
  automatically on desktop-client startup. Agents that were created
  with earlier minds versions need to be re-created to pick up the new
  env vars; without them their `latchkey` CLI calls will be rejected by
  the now-password-protected gateway.

## 2026-05-06

`apps/minds/scripts/propagate_changes` now protects `.claude/settings.local.json` from `rsync --delete` when syncing the template into an agent's work_dir.

That file is generated per-agent at create time by mngr's `_configure_agent_hooks` and holds the `UserPromptSubmit` hook that signals `tmux wait-for -S "mngr-submit-..."`. Without it, every `send_message` hangs the 90-second submission-signal timeout while the prompt is actually delivered to Claude (so the UI shows the message and Claude responds normally, but the HTTP `/message` request times out).

Previously the script only protected `runtime/` and `.mngr/`, so iterating with `propagate_changes` reliably reproduced the hang -- and there was no easy way to recover short of recreating the agent.

Fix WebSocket broadcaster queue-full flood and hung-send pin: stuck WS clients are evicted after 50 consecutive queue-full broadcasts, and the broadcaster cancels the wedged handler's asyncio task to free a coroutine blocked in `await websocket.send_text(...)` on a half-dead TCP connection. The previous behaviour pegged a CPU core and filled tmux with `WebSocket client queue full, dropping message` warnings whenever a single client stopped draining its queue.

Adds a spec for backing up the gitignored `runtime/` folder of forever-claude-template (which now also contains `memory/` and `tickets/`) into the same private repo on a separate orphan branch, plus a periodic backup service and `GH_TOKEN`-based auto-push setup.

- minds desktop client: when a discovery error from the connector indicates a revoked SuperTokens session for a specific imbue_cloud account, the matching `[providers.imbue_cloud_<slug>]` block is automatically marked `is_enabled = false` and `mngr observe` is bounced so the dead account stops poisoning subsequent discovery cycles. Signing back in (email/password or OAuth) re-enables the provider. The Manage Accounts page shows a "Signed out" badge + "Sign in again" link for any account whose provider is currently disabled.
- minds desktop client now installs a grandparent-death watcher when the Python backend starts: if Electron crashes (or is otherwise killed without running its on-quit handler), the Python backend self-terminates within ~3 seconds, and the cascade brings down its `mngr observe`/`mngr events`/latchkey children via their own watchers. Previously a crashed Electron left an orphan tree alive across restarts.
- minds: SIGTERM that minds itself sends to `mngr observe` / `mngr event` subprocesses (during shutdown, observe restart, or events-stream sync after an agent leaves the discovery snapshot) no longer surfaces as a "subprocess failed" notification.

- minds: redesigned the "Create a Project" screen.
  - Removed the "Include .env file" checkbox.
  - Added an "AI provider" choice (`imbue_cloud`, `api_key`, `subscription`) that is independent from the compute provider, so any combination is valid as long as `imbue_cloud` is paired with a selected account.
  - Renamed the "Launch mode" dropdown to "Compute provider"; both compute and AI provider default to `imbue_cloud` when an account is selected.
  - Selecting `api_key` reveals a required Anthropic API key field; `subscription` injects no Anthropic credentials so the user can sign in interactively after the workspace starts.
  - Selecting `imbue_cloud` for either field with no account is rejected by both the form (with a warning) and the server (with a 400).
  - Added an optional `GH_TOKEN` field under Advanced settings that is forwarded to the agent host (or the agent in DEV mode).

Cleanup pass after splitting functionality out of minds into the `mngr_imbue_cloud` and `mngr_forward` plugins.

- The "Share" button in a workspace now opens a static informational modal that points the user at the desktop app, rather than writing a sharing-request event back to minds. Direct sharing editing from the desktop client (workspace settings page) is unchanged. Permissions / latchkey request flows are unchanged.
- Minds no longer persists `imbue_cloud` account identity (email, display_name) to disk. Only the workspace<->account association map lives in `~/.minds/workspace_associations.json`; identity is sourced on demand from the new `mngr imbue_cloud auth list` command and cached in memory.
- Destroyed agents now disappear from the projects index automatically without requiring the user to click into the destroying detail page first.

# minds run

A new `minds run` command rewires the minds desktop client to spawn
`mngr forward` as a subprocess instead of running the same forwarding
logic in-process:

```bash
minds run --port 8420 --mngr-forward-port 8421
```

- Spawns `mngr forward --service system_interface --preauth-cookie ...`
  and consumes its envelope JSONL stream on stdout.
- Serves the slimmed minds bare-origin UI on `--port` (default 8420);
  agent subdomains are served by the spawned `mngr forward` on
  `--mngr-forward-port` (default 8421).
- Emits a `mngr_forward_started` JSONL event on stdout carrying the
  preauth cookie value so the Electron shell can pre-set
  `mngr_forward_session=<value>` on `localhost:<mngr-forward-port>`
  before the first agent-subdomain navigation.
- Sends `SIGHUP` to the plugin's PID after a freshly-written
  `[providers.imbue_cloud_<slug>]` block in `settings.toml` so the new
  provider becomes visible without restarting the plugin.

The legacy `minds forward` command and its in-process forwarding /
auth / subdomain code are intentionally unchanged in this branch and
keep working. A follow-up branch will delete the now-duplicated
in-process paths.

QA pass for the merged forwarding refactor on top of `josh/imbue_cloud_ready`:

- Resolved a `test_ratchets.py` merge conflict in `mngr_imbue_cloud` (kept the standard layout, set the `bare_print` snapshot to 1 to match the surviving `sys.stderr.write` in `cli/admin.py`).
- Pruned the dead `tunnel_token_store` re-injection path from `LocalAgentDiscoveryHandler` (the parallel `mngr/imbue-cloud` branch dropped that cache; the agent's container persists the token now and rebuilds re-fire the post-create injection).
- Passed `concurrency_group=` to `LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler` in the new `minds run` entry point.
- Switched `apps/minds/electron/backend.js` from spawning `minds forward` to `minds run` so QA exercises the `mngr_forward` plugin subprocess + `EnvelopeStreamConsumer` path.
- Ported `start_grandparent_death_watcher` (Electron-exit detection) and `_ImbueCloudAuthErrorDisabler` (auto-disable an imbue_cloud account whose session has been revoked) from the legacy `desktop_client/runner.py` over to the new `cli/run.py` path. Added an `add_on_provider_error_callback` API on `EnvelopeStreamConsumer` so the disabler has somewhere to register.
- Phase 2 cleanup of the `mngr_forward` split:
  - Deleted `desktop_client/runner.py` and `cli/forward.py` + `cli/forward_test.py` (the legacy `minds forward` command).
  - Deleted `MngrStreamManager` from `desktop_client/backend_resolver.py` (replaced by `EnvelopeStreamConsumer` in `forward_cli.py`) and dropped the corresponding test block from `backend_resolver_test.py`.
  - Slimmed `desktop_client/cookie_manager.py` to the minds bare-origin session helpers; the per-subdomain auth-token helpers live in the plugin's `cookie.py`.
  - Slimmed `desktop_client/app.py`: deleted the host-header subdomain-forwarding middleware and many supporting helpers; `create_desktop_client(...)` no longer takes `tunnel_manager`, `latchkey`, or `stream_manager`; it gains `mngr_forward_port` + `mngr_forward_preauth_cookie` so server-to-server refresh broadcasts route through the plugin.
  - Rewired `_dispatch_refresh_broadcast` to POST through the plugin's per-agent subdomain (`<agent>.localhost:<plugin_port>/api/refresh-service/<svc>/broadcast`) with the preauth cookie, instead of opening its own SSH tunnel.
  - `supertokens_routes._bounce_mngr_observe` → `_bounce_forward_observe`: sends `SIGHUP` via `EnvelopeStreamConsumer.bounce_observe()`. Dropped the legacy `MngrStreamManager` fallback.
  - Templates and static JS now point `/goto/<agent>/` links at the plugin's port via a `mngr_forward_origin` Jinja variable / `data-mngr-forward-origin` attribute.
  - Electron's `backend.js` exposes a new `onMngrForwardStarted` callback; `main.js` consumes the `mngr_forward_started` event from `minds run` stdout and pre-sets the `mngr_forward_session=<preauth>` cookie on `localhost:<plugin_port>` (default + content session) before any agent-subdomain navigation.
  - Updated user-facing references to `minds forward` → `minds run` in `apps/minds/README.md` and `apps/minds/docs/{design,desktop-app,overview,workspace/getting_started,workspace/glossary}.md`.

## 2026-05-05

- Fixed: closing the last tab in a minds workspace no longer leaves a blank screen with no recovery path. The primary agent's chat tab is automatically reopened when the dockview becomes empty (whether by closing all tabs at runtime or restoring an empty saved layout).
