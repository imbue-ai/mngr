# Releasing a new minds.app

A release ships three pinned artifacts that must agree:

| Artifact | Pinned where |
|---|---|
| mngr code | a `main` SHA, tagged `minds-v<version>` |
| FCT template | the `minds-v<version>` tag on `forever-claude-template` `main` |
| `.app` bundle | a ToDesktop build keyed by that mngr SHA |

Both repos tag with the **`minds-v<version>`** prefix (e.g. `minds-v0.3.1`), namespacing minds releases from each repo's own `v<version>`. The shipped binary clones the FCT tag at runtime via `FALLBACK_BRANCH` in `apps/minds/imbue/minds/desktop_client/templates.py`; tag immutability pins a binary to the snapshot it was verified against.

The mngr side releases from **`main`** via **one PR** (the reviewable change). The FCT `vendor/mngr` refresh is **not** a PR: it is a mechanical, reproduction-verified mirror of the mngr SHA, so it lands as a **direct commit pushed to FCT `main`** (no review). The arc: prove the pair green pre-merge (mngr PR branch × the pushed FCT vendor branch), review + merge the mngr PR, tag both `main`s at the verified SHA, then re-prove green against the tags. **Green CI on the tags concludes the release**; clicking *Release* in ToDesktop is an optional follow-up.

Reuse the same mngr SHA / ToDesktop build across release iterations where you can — launch-to-msg reuses it by `commit_sha` and the ToDesktop build is the slow step — but don't force it: cut a fresh SHA whenever an `apps/minds` change actually needs to ship.

## The mngr PR + the FCT vendor sync

| Repo | Carries | How it lands |
|---|---|---|
| `mngr` | version bump (`apps/minds/package.json`), `FALLBACK_BRANCH` (`templates.py`), any mngr/minds code | **PR** → `main` (merge commit) |
| `forever-claude-template` | `vendor/mngr/` archived from the verified mngr SHA | **direct commit pushed to `main`** (no PR) |

The vendor refresh carries no review value — it is a byte-for-byte `git archive` of the mngr SHA, verified by reproduction (the step-6 `diff -r` check), not by reading hundreds of generated files. So skip the PR ceremony and push it straight to `main`.

**Reviewable consumer changes are the exception.** If the new vendor changes an mngr API a consumer (e.g. `system_interface`) calls and you must fix that consumer, that fix *is* reviewable — land it as its own normal FCT PR (reviewed + merged) **before** the vendor push, then direct-push the vendor sync on top. Keep reviewable code out of the vendor commit.

**Vendor-match invariant.** FCT `vendor/mngr` must be the `git archive` of the *exact* mngr SHA it's paired with — the `commit_sha` you verify and the mngr SHA you tag. The binary runs the mngr SHA; the in-VM agent imports `vendor/mngr`. If they diverge, the agent's mngr can mismatch the binary's API (how the `system_interface` → `send_message_to_agents` break slipped in). Re-archive whenever the mngr SHA changes.

> The Apple-Silicon lima-VZ `cryptography` SIGILL is handled in the FCT template by `OPENSSL_armcap=0` (`.mngr/settings.toml` `host_env__extend` + `scripts/build_workspace.sh`), which skips OpenSSL's SVE CPU-cap probe. mngr does not pin `cryptography`.

**The vendor sync is verified by reproduction, not review.** It is a single mechanical commit (`Sync vendor/mngr to <branch> (<sha>)`) holding the `git archive` of the mngr SHA — nothing to read. The step-6 vendor-match check (`git archive <sha> | tar -x -C tmp && diff -r tmp vendor/mngr`) proves it equals the tagged mngr SHA; a clean diff *is* the review. So it skips PR review entirely and is pushed straight to FCT `main`. (`vendor/mngr/**` is also `linguist-generated` in FCT's `.gitattributes`, so it stays collapsed wherever it does surface.)

## File reference

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Version string | `apps/minds/package.json` `version` |
| Baked FCT tag | `apps/minds/imbue/minds/desktop_client/templates.py` `FALLBACK_BRANCH` |
| `forever-claude-template` checkout | `$FCT` — your local clone; `just sync-vendor-mngr` (step 3) reads its path from a gitignored `apps/minds/.env`. See Session setup. |
| `mngr` monorepo checkout | `$MNGR` — wherever you cloned it; you run `just` / `git` from here. See Session setup. |
| Build / e2e CI | `.github/workflows/minds-launch-to-msg.yml` (`workflow_dispatch`) |
| Traditional CI | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (auto on push) |

## Session setup

Set these once for the whole session — later steps assume them:

- **`GH_TOKEN`** (derived, per session) — `export GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user weishi-imbue)`. Pre-flight any push with `gh api user --jq .login` → must print `weishi-imbue` (the keychain "active" account drifts between parallel agents).
- **`MNGR`** and **`FCT`** — absolute paths to your `mngr` and `forever-claude-template` clones, used by the shell commands in steps 4/6/7: `export MNGR=/your/mngr FCT=/your/forever-claude-template`.
- **`FCT_DIR`** — the *same* `forever-claude-template` path, but consumed by `just sync-vendor-mngr` (step 3), which reads it from a gitignored `apps/minds/.env` (minds-scoped, never committed — only that recipe loads it, so no shell-rc edit and it reaches non-interactive agent shells; see `apps/minds/.env.example`):
  ```bash
  echo "FCT_DIR=$FCT" >> apps/minds/.env
  ```
  An agent: if `apps/minds/.env` doesn't already define `FCT_DIR`, ask the user for their checkout path — don't guess.

## Procedure

### 1. Bump version + FALLBACK_BRANCH (mngr PR)

For an iteration of the same version, skip. To bump: set `apps/minds/package.json` `version` (e.g. `0.3.1`) and `templates.py` `FALLBACK_BRANCH` to `"minds-v0.3.1"`. This bakes in a tag that doesn't exist until step 7 — fine, because step 4 overrides the FCT ref via `template_ref`, so the tag is only hit in step 8.

### 2. Traditional CI green on the mngr PR branch

`ci.yml` must be all-green on the mngr PR HEAD (jobs: `test-offload`, `test-docker`, `test-docker-electron`, `test-offload-acceptance`). The FCT vendor sync has no PR and no `ci.yml` of its own to gate here — it is verified by the step-4 launch-to-msg run and the step-6 reproduction check.

### 3. Refresh FCT `vendor/mngr` from the green mngr SHA (no PR)

On an FCT branch cut from `origin/main` (clean tree — this branch exists only to carry the vendor commit for step-4 verification; it is **not** opened as a PR), with the **mngr checkout positioned at the green SHA from step 2** (i.e. on the mngr release PR branch), run the sync recipe.

`just sync-vendor-mngr` reads `FCT_DIR` from your `apps/minds/.env` (Session setup) — no path is baked into the justfile. It does `git archive HEAD` → FCT `vendor/mngr` (tracked files only; keep `apps/minds/`), commits `Sync vendor/mngr to <branch> (<short>)`, aborts if FCT is dirty, and **does not push** — it prints the exact `cd … && git push` line (with the resolved FCT path) for you to run. For why releases use `git archive` (vs the dev loop's `rsync`), see `apps/minds/docs/vendor-mngr-sync.md`.

```bash
just sync-vendor-mngr                       # reads FCT_DIR from .env
# (or pass the path explicitly: just sync-vendor-mngr /abs/path/to/forever-claude-template)
# then copy the `To publish: (cd <fct> && git push origin <branch>)` line the recipe
# printed (it already has the resolved absolute path) and run it verbatim
```

If the new vendor changes an mngr API a consumer calls (e.g. `system_interface`), land that consumer fix as its own normal FCT PR (reviewed + merged) **before** the vendor push, and keep it out of the vendor commit.

### 4. Prove the pair green pre-merge

The tag doesn't exist yet, so pass the FCT vendor branch as `template_ref`. `commit_sha` and that branch's `vendor/mngr` must be the same mngr SHA.

```bash
GREEN_MNGR_SHA=<the green mngr SHA from step 2>   # carried through to steps 6-8
cd "$MNGR"
gh workflow run minds-launch-to-msg.yml -R imbue-ai/mngr \
  -r <mngr-pr-branch> -f commit_sha="$GREEN_MNGR_SHA" -f template_ref=<fct-vendor-branch>
```

`build` packages/reuses (keyed by `commit_sha`) the bundle; `launch_to_msg` launches it, creates an agent from the FCT ref, sends a first message, asserts the round-trip. Invoke from the mngr cwd — from the FCT cwd it has 404'd mid-create and duplicated the run.

### 5. Review and approve the mngr PR

Only the mngr PR needs review (still a branch ref; nothing tagged yet). The FCT vendor sync has no PR — it is verified by reproduction (see above). Any reviewable FCT consumer change is its own separate PR, already merged by this point.

### 6. Merge the mngr PR + push the FCT vendor to `main`

**Merge the mngr PR with a merge commit, not a squash.** `main` can advance past the SHA you built and verified in step 4 (`$GREEN_MNGR_SHA`) while you were verifying; a merge commit keeps that exact SHA reachable on `main` as a parent (a squash replaces it with a new commit whose tree also contains the drift — and the binary you verified was built from neither).

Then push the FCT vendor commit **directly to FCT `main`** (no PR) — fast-forward from the branch you verified in step 4:

```bash
GREEN_MNGR_SHA=<the SHA from step 4>
git -C "$FCT" fetch origin --quiet
git -C "$FCT" push https://x-access-token:$GH_TOKEN@github.com/imbue-ai/forever-claude-template.git <fct-vendor-branch>:main
```

If FCT `main` moved since step 3 the fast-forward is rejected — rebase the vendor branch onto `origin/main`, re-run the step-6 vendor-match check below, and re-verify (step 4) if anything material changed.

The tag pins **`$GREEN_MNGR_SHA`** — the SHA the binary was built from and FCT's `vendor/mngr` was archived from — **not** `main`'s HEAD. Confirm the *commit you'll actually tag* (FCT `origin/main` post-push, not your local working copy) still matches that SHA:

```bash
GREEN_MNGR_SHA=<the SHA from step 4>
git -C "$FCT" fetch origin --quiet
A=$(mktemp -d); B=$(mktemp -d)
(cd "$MNGR" && git archive "$GREEN_MNGR_SHA") | tar -x -C "$A"    # the mngr SHA you'll tag
git -C "$FCT" archive origin/main:vendor/mngr | tar -x -C "$B"    # the FCT commit you'll tag
diff -r "$A" "$B" && echo OK || echo "MISMATCH — FCT origin/main vendor != archive $GREEN_MNGR_SHA (re-run step 3 / re-merge FCT)"
```

`git archive main` (HEAD) failing to match while `git archive $GREEN_MNGR_SHA` matches is **expected drift** (unrelated PRs landed on `main`), not an error — tag `$GREEN_MNGR_SHA`, not HEAD.

### 7. Tag the verified pair — *not* `main` HEAD

Tag mngr at **`$GREEN_MNGR_SHA`** (the built+verified SHA; reachable on `main` as the merge parent) and FCT at the commit whose `vendor/mngr` is that SHA's archive (the vendor commit you pushed to `main` in step 6):

```bash
# $GH_TOKEN, $MNGR, $FCT from Session setup
VERSION=minds-v0.3.1
GREEN_MNGR_SHA=<the SHA from step 4>
git -C "$FCT" fetch origin --quiet; FCT_SHA=$(git -C "$FCT" rev-parse origin/main)   # vendor/mngr == archive $GREEN_MNGR_SHA (verified in step 6)

git -C "$MNGR" tag -a "$VERSION" "$GREEN_MNGR_SHA" -m "minds $VERSION: mngr $(git -C "$MNGR" rev-parse --short $GREEN_MNGR_SHA) / FCT $(git -C "$FCT" rev-parse --short $FCT_SHA) (vendor/mngr from mngr $GREEN_MNGR_SHA)"
git -C "$MNGR" push https://x-access-token:$GH_TOKEN@github.com/imbue-ai/mngr.git refs/tags/"$VERSION"

git -C "$FCT" tag -a "$VERSION" "$FCT_SHA" -m "minds $VERSION: FCT $(git -C "$FCT" rev-parse --short $FCT_SHA) / mngr $(git -C "$MNGR" rev-parse --short $GREEN_MNGR_SHA) (vendor/mngr from mngr $GREEN_MNGR_SHA)"
git -C "$FCT" push https://x-access-token:$GH_TOKEN@github.com/imbue-ai/forever-claude-template.git refs/tags/"$VERSION"
```

Tags must be annotated (`-a`). **Tag the verified SHA, never `main` HEAD** — between step 4 and the merge, `main` can pick up unrelated commits never built into the binary or run through launch-to-msg (e.g. `main` HEAD once sat +58 such files past the tagged SHA). To re-cut during iteration: `git tag -d "$VERSION"` then `git push --force ... refs/tags/"$VERSION"`.

### 8. Close the loop: CI on the two tags

Both refs = the tag, exercising the binary's baked `FALLBACK_BRANCH` end to end. Because the mngr tag is the step-4 SHA, `build` reuses the bundle you already verified:

```bash
cd "$MNGR"; VERSION=minds-v0.3.1
gh workflow run minds-launch-to-msg.yml -R imbue-ai/mngr \
  -r main -f commit_sha="$VERSION" -f template_ref="$VERSION"
```

**Green here concludes the release.** Note the build ID in the `build` summary.

### 9. Optional: dev verify + ship

Drive the build's ToDesktop zip (`https://dl.todesktop.com/26032588hqdzk/builds/<build_id>/mac/zip/arm64`, replaces `/Applications/Minds.app`) or the dev build through create-agent → first message. To publish, click **Release** at `https://app.todesktop.com/apps/26032588hqdzk/builds/<build_id>` (the `todesktop release` CLI is auth-blocked); auto-updater picks it up on next launch.

## Failure modes worth knowing

- **`test-docker-electron` aborts on `git checkout minds-v<version>` with dirty `.mngr/settings.toml`.** The runner pre-checks-out the FCT clone to `FALLBACK_BRANCH` after the tag fetch so the in-place checkout is a no-op. If you bump `FALLBACK_BRANCH`, the tag must be reachable on FCT origin (step 7) first.
- **`gh workflow run` creates a duplicate run.** Always invoke from the mngr cwd (step 4).
- **`mngr create` fails "Remote branch minds-v<version> not found".** The CI shallow clone runs `git fetch --depth 1 --tags origin`; if it still fails on a fresh runner, confirm the tag was pushed (step 7).
- **Renamed workflow's sidebar entry sticks.** GHA unregisters only once all its runs are deleted: `PUT .../workflows/{id}/disable`, then `DELETE .../runs/{run_id}` for each.
- **launch-to-msg fails at the Slack step (`canned body not in chat after 360s`) or a `bing`/`bong` follow-up timeout.** `build`, `macos_launch`, W1 create and `pong` all pass first, so it is isolated to a later agent-reply gate. **This is NOT a permission bug** (a tempting misread): the latchkey gateway log in the artifact (`latchkey/mngr_latchkey/events.jsonl`) shows the full working sequence — `conversations.list -> 403` (pre-grant), `POST /permissions/rules` (the Approve), then `conversations.list`/`history -> 200` (the agent reads the message). The `99-TIMEOUT` screenshot's *"Waiting for you to approve"* is a **stale progress block**, not the live state. The real failure is **the agent's `system_interface` backend going unreachable after the read** — the on-failure probe shows `curl :1234 from VM -> http_code=000` while the `web-server` process is still alive, so the chat↔agent relay is down and the ~12 e2e "retry" kicks get no response. Adding response timeout does **not** help a dead backend. It is intermittent (a clean retry passes), so for the release **re-run launch-to-msg** (build reused by `commit_sha`, ~40-min e2e) — but treat a recurring one as a real `system_interface`/`mngr_forward` reliability bug to fix, not a release blocker to paper over.
