## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Changed: `remote_service_connector.add_service` is now idempotent; updating an access list no longer fails Cloudflare 81053 ("DNS record already exists").
- Changed: Connector schema migration replaces `pool_hosts.version` with `attributes JSONB`; legacy `version` callers are folded into `attributes` automatically.
