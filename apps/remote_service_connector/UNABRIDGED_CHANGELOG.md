# Unabridged Changelog - remote_service_connector

Full, unedited changelog entries consolidated nightly from individual files in `apps/remote_service_connector/changelog/`.

For a concise summary, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-05-06

- remote_service_connector: `add_service` is now idempotent. Updating the access list on a previously-shared service (which re-runs the full create-tunnel/add-service/set-auth chain) no longer fails with Cloudflare error 81053 ("DNS record already exists"). When a CNAME or ingress rule for the hostname is already in place pointing at the same tunnel, it is reused; if the per-service auth policy was already customized via `set_service_auth`, the tunnel default is no longer reapplied on top.

- Connector schema migration: `pool_hosts.version` is replaced with a flexible `attributes JSONB` column. `/hosts/lease` matches with `attributes @> request_attributes`. Backwards-compatible: legacy callers can still pass `version` as a top-level field; the connector folds it into attributes automatically.
