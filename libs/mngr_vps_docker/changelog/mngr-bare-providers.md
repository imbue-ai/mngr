Introduced a `HostRealizer` seam inside the VPS provider as the first step toward
running agents directly on a cloud VM (no Docker container). The provider now
selects a realizer from a new `isolation` config knob (`IsolationMode.CONTAINER`
| `NONE`); `CONTAINER` is the default and preserves the original behavior
exactly. All Docker-container placement logic (image build/pull, container run,
in-container sshd setup, btrfs volume + snapshot helper, container
stop/start/teardown, and `docker commit` snapshots) moved behind a
`DockerRealizer` that the provider's base methods delegate to. The agent SSH
endpoint, placement lifecycle, and snapshots are now realizer concerns, while the
machine (provisioning, boot, instance lifecycle, host record, discovery) stays
with the provider.

Host-record store resolution also moved behind the realizer
(`realizer.open_host_store(outer, host_id)`), so a non-Docker placement can
persist its host record without a Docker volume. The container realizer
resolves the per-host Docker volume exactly as before.

Selecting `isolation=NONE` is accepted by config but currently raises
`BareIsolationNotYetSupportedError`; the bare realizer lands in a follow-up. No
user-visible behavior changes for existing aws/gcp/azure/vultr/ovh/imbue_cloud
providers.
