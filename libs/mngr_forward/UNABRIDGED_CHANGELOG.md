## 2026-05-09

- Fixed: the `mngr forward` subprocess no longer pegs ~130% CPU after agents disconnect. The bidirectional relay loop (now lifted to a single shared module at `libs/mngr_forward/imbue/mngr_forward/relay.py`, used by both the desktop client's reverse tunnels and `mngr forward`'s direct-tcpip forwards) terminates when the paramiko channel has received EOF; previously `select.select` would mark the channel readable but `recv_ready()` returned False, falling through and spinning the loop at ~1M iters/sec on each half-closed channel.

# mngr_forward plugin

A new `mngr_forward` plugin (in `libs/mngr_forward/`) lands the auth +
subdomain-forwarding logic that used to live inside the minds desktop
client. The plugin runs as a standalone tool:

```bash
mngr plugin enable forward
mngr forward --service system_interface
```

What you get:

- Local proxy on `127.0.0.1:8421` that serves
  `<agent-id>.localhost:8421/*` and byte-forwards each HTTP and WebSocket
  request to the agent's `system_interface` URL via SSH tunnels for
  remote agents.
- One-time login URL printed to stderr (or emitted as a JSONL `login_url`
  event in `--format jsonl`); the resulting cookie is signed with a key
  persisted under `$MNGR_HOST_DIR/plugin/forward/` so browser sessions
  survive plugin restarts.
- `--reverse <remote-port>:<local-port>` (repeatable) sets up reverse SSH
  tunnels for every discovered remote agent. `<remote-port>` may be `0`
  for sshd-assigned ports; the actual bound port is reported via a
  `forward.reverse_tunnel_established` envelope event.
- `--no-observe --forward-port REMOTE_PORT` mode runs `mngr list` once
  and forwards a fixed snapshot. `--no-observe --service NAME` is rejected
  as a CLI usage error.
- `--agent-include` / `--agent-exclude` / `--event-include` /
  `--event-exclude` CEL filters control which agents and event sources
  the plugin tracks.
- `SIGHUP` bounces only the `mngr observe` child subprocess; SSH tunnels,
  per-agent event subprocesses, browser sessions, and the FastAPI app
  stay alive.
