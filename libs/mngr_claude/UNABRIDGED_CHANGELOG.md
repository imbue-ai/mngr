- Fixed: a cloned claude agent now actually resumes the source agent's conversation (the model sees and acts on the source's history), not just inherits the session JSONL on disk. Previously, after #1598's cross-host plugin/ rsync, claude on the destination would still start fresh because the JSONL was filed under the *source's* encoded work_dir, the rsynced ``sessions-index.json`` pointed at source paths, and ``claude_session_id`` was wrong. ``_adopt_cloned_session`` now renames the project subdir to the destination's realpath-resolved encoding (handles the ``/mngr/projects/agent-X`` → ``/__modal/volumes/<vol-id>/projects/agent-X`` symlink on Modal), drops the stale index, writes ``claude_session_id`` to the JSONL filename's stem (the ground truth — the source's own ``claude_session_id`` file holds the agent UUID from the SessionStart hook default rather than the real id), and carries forward ``claude_session_id_history``. The ``--adopt-session`` flow shares the same finalize step.

Add a `use_env_config_dir` option on the `claude` agent type config. When set
to `true`, local Claude agents share the user's `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` instead of
provisioning a per-agent config dir, and mngr does not write to the user's
Claude config (no trust additions, dialog dismissal, per-agent settings, or
keychain provisioning). Only supported for local hosts; `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
must be set. The user is responsible for one-time interactive `claude` setup.
See `libs/mngr_claude/README.md` for details.

## 2026-05-06

- Stop the `claude plugin update` SessionStart hook from hanging Modal-launched
  agents at an `ssh` first-contact (TOFU) prompt for github.com. The plugin
  updater shells out to `git pull`, which uses `ssh` -- on a fresh sandbox
  with no `~/.ssh/known_hosts` entry, ssh blocks on a "Are you sure you
  want to continue connecting" prompt that Claude Code's bypass-permissions
  setting does not cover. `scripts/claude_update_plugin.sh` now prefixes
  the update with `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
  -o BatchMode=yes'`, which writes the first-seen host key to known_hosts
  and exits non-interactively if anything goes wrong (matching the
  script's existing `2>/dev/null || true` failure tolerance).
