"""High-level helpers for wiring latchkey into a freshly-created agent.

The lifecycle for a new agent has three latchkey-aware steps:

1. *Before* ``mngr create``: allocate an opaque permissions handle,
   materialize it with a deny-all baseline, mint a permissions-override
   JWT pointing at it, and assemble the env vars the agent needs
   (``LATCHKEY_GATEWAY``, ``LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD``,
   ``LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE``,
   ``LATCHKEY_DISABLE_COUNTING``). See :func:`prepare_agent_latchkey`.

2. *After* ``mngr create`` returns the canonical host id: replace the
   opaque handle with a symlink to the canonical host-keyed
   ``latchkey_permissions.json`` so the desktop's permission-grant flow
   writes to the canonical path while the gateway reads through the
   symlink. See :func:`finalize_host_permissions`.

3. (Out of scope here.) When the agent is later discovered, the
   :class:`LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler` ensures the shared gateway is up
   and reverse-tunnels it into the agent for non-DEV launches.

Both helpers raise on failure (``LatchkeyError`` from the upstream
CLI, ``LatchkeyStoreError`` from on-disk persistence). Callers decide
whether to fail agent creation or just surface a warning -- the helpers
themselves don't make that policy call.

The one place ``prepare_agent_latchkey`` *does* tolerate an absent
dependency is when ``latchkey`` itself is ``None``: that's a degraded
test / no-password-gateway mode where we still produce the constant
agent-side gateway URL but skip the password / JWT / opaque-handle
steps that need a working ``Latchkey``.

    ``is_tunneled`` selects how the agent reaches the gateway:

    * ``True`` (containers, VMs, VPS, leased hosts): the agent's
      ``LATCHKEY_GATEWAY`` points at the constant agent-side loopback
      ``http://127.0.0.1:<AGENT_SIDE_LATCHKEY_PORT>``. A reverse SSH
      tunnel set up at agent-discovery time bridges this to the
      gateway's dynamic host port. The gateway is *not* started here --
      the discovery handler does that on its own when the agent shows
      up. (Starting the gateway eagerly would force every ``mngr create``
      to spawn a gateway even for tests that never exercise latchkey.)
      ``concurrency_group`` is ignored in this mode.
    * ``False`` (DEV / on-bare-host agents): the agent runs on the same
      host as the gateway and reaches it directly. We have to start the
      gateway *now* to learn its dynamic port and bake it into
      ``LATCHKEY_GATEWAY``. ``concurrency_group`` becomes the owner of
      the spawned gateway subprocess; it must be supplied whenever

    ``latchkey=None`` is a degraded mode for tests / no-password-gateway

    ``is_tunneled=True`` (the URL alone is meaningful) but skip the

    ``latchkey=None`` there is no live port to inject either, so we

            not make that policy call.
        LatchkeyStoreError: when materializing the opaque permissions
