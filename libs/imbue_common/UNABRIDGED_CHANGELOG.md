Project now participates in the per-project changelog layout: a `changelog/` subdirectory holds per-PR entry files, and `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` at the project root hold the consolidated history. See the full rationale in `dev/changelog/mngr-changelog-per-project.md`.

- imbue_common: extend `TEST_FILE_PATTERNS` (used by all standard ratchet checks to skip test files) from `("*_test.py", "test_*.py")` to `("*_test.py", "test_*.py", "conftest.py", "testing.py")` -- aligning with the wheel-exclude pattern from #1505 so `testing.py` and `conftest.py` are uniformly recognized as test code across ratchets. Existing snapshots are not affected (the change can only reduce violation counts; current snapshots are upper bounds).
