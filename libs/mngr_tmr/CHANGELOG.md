## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr_tmr` is now a thin recipe on top of the new `mngr_mapreduce` framework — all agent launching / polling / extraction code moved out, and TMR is expressed as a `TestMapReduceRecipe` (in `imbue.mngr_tmr.recipe`). The `mngr tmr` CLI surface is unchanged for users. Server-side labels renamed to `mapreduce_role` / `mapreduce_run_name`; outputs-archive path simplified to `plugin/mapreduce/outputs.tar.gz`. Agents from older TMR runs are not discoverable by this version.
- Changed: Integrator now runs on the same `--provider` as the testing agents and reuses any snapshot they built, so on remote providers it spins up just as quickly as the test agents do instead of running locally. Local testing agents switched from `GIT_WORKTREE` to `GIT_MIRROR` transfer mode to unify the integrator code path across providers.
- Changed: `mngr tmr` testing agents now publish a single `outputs.tar.gz` archive into the per-agent volume API, replacing the rsync + git-pull finalization; SSH provider no longer supported for testing-agent outputs.
- Changed: TMR run names are now a single compact timestamp `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` used consistently across the output directory, the `tmr_run_name` agent label, and every TMR-spawned entity's agent / host / branch names. Testing agents are `tmr-<run>-<test_name>`, branches `mngr-tmr/<run>/<test_name>`, and the random hex id is gone.
- Changed: Added `--run-name` flag to override the auto-generated run name.
- Changed: HTML report is now mirrored to `s3://int8-shared-internal/tmr-reports/<run>.html` (us-west-2) on every regeneration when AWS credentials are set; the public URL `http://go/shared/tmr-reports/<run>.html` is printed and emitted as a structured `report_url` event.
- Changed: `tmr_role` agent label (`testing` / `snapshotter` / `integrator`) replaces the previous name-prefix matching for filtering integrator agents during `--reintegrate`; derived directly from `AgentKind` which gained a `SNAPSHOTTER` variant.

### Removed

- Removed: `--integrator-provider`, `--integrator-type`, `--integrator-template` CLI flags — pass `--provider` once for both testing agents and the integrator. `--integrator-timeout` is unchanged.
- Removed: `--use-snapshot` CLI flag — snapshot building is now automatic whenever the provider supports it (modal today). `--snapshot <ID>` still works for reusing an existing snapshot.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `mngr tmr --provider modal --use-snapshot` now bootstraps the Modal per-user environment on first run instead of aborting with `ProviderEmptyError`; the pre-snapshot provider lookup passes `is_for_host_creation=True` to match the create path.
- Fixed: Several silent-success failure modes now exit non-zero — `--reintegrate` when `mngr list` fails or no agents match the run name, and any tmr run where every test agent failed to launch.

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added: New `mngr tmr --additional-authorized-host` repeatable flag for installing SSH public keys on every agent host.

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr tmr --use-snapshot` no longer re-uploads the code repo per test agent — agents source from on-host `/code` via `git-worktree`.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added: TMR `integrator_branch` event on `mngr tmr`'s structured stdout (`--format jsonl`/`json`).

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr tmr` HTML reports gain a dedicated "Failed" section separate from "Blocked" (infrastructure failures vs. agent-reported BLOCKED), and now include rows for launch-failed agents.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `mngr tmr` no longer crashes the whole orchestrator when a single agent fails its initial-message send — launching loops also catch `AgentError`, and failed launches render as errored entries in HTML reports.
- Fixed: `mngr tmr` integrator launch (and any local-provider test-agent launch) no longer always fails with "Failed to generate a unique host name after 100 attempts"; TMR now reuses the existing local host when the provider is `local`.
