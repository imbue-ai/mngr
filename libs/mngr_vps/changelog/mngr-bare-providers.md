Introduced a `HostRealizer` seam inside the VPS provider as the first step toward
running agents directly on a cloud VM (no Docker container). The provider now
selects a realizer from a new `isolation` config knob (`IsolationMode.CONTAINER`
| `NONE`); `CONTAINER` is the default and preserves the original behavior
exactly. All Docker-container placement logic (image build/pull, container run,
in-container sshd setup, btrfs volume + snapshot helper, container
stop/start/teardown, and `docker commit` snapshots) moved behind a
`DockerRealizer` that the provider's base methods delegate to. The agent SSH
endpoint, placement lifecycle, and snapshots are now realizer concerns, while the
machine (provisioning, boot, instance lifecycle, host record, discovery) stays
with the provider.

Host-record store resolution also moved behind the realizer
(`realizer.open_host_store(outer, host_id)`), so a non-Docker placement can
persist its host record without a Docker volume. The container realizer
resolves the per-host Docker volume exactly as before.

Added the `BareRealizer`: it places the agent directly on the VM's OS (no
Docker), reached at `vps_ip:22` as root with the same VPS keypair the provider
already uses for the outer. It installs the lightweight host packages and mngr
host_dir layout on the VM (the same setup the container gets, applied to the OS),
keeps the host record in a plain root-disk directory, and reports no snapshot
support. Machine stop/start/destroy stays the substrate's job, so the bare
placement lifecycle steps are no-ops.

Discovery and listing also moved behind the realizer: finding the host on a
VPS, reading its running state, and collecting the live agent listing are now
realizer methods (`find_host_record`, `read_live_listing`, `is_placement_running`,
`collect_listing_output`). The container realizer keeps the exact Docker probes
(`docker ps` label lookup, `docker inspect`, `docker exec`); the bare realizer
reads the record from the fixed store path and runs the listing script directly
on the VM. Behavior-preserving for Docker.

The `AGENT_TAG_FIELDS` constant (used by the AWS/Azure tag-mirror code) is now
public, matching its sibling `AGENT_TAG_PREFIX`, so it is no longer imported as
a private name across modules.

`VpsHostConfig.container_name`/`volume_name` are now nullable so a bare host
record (which has no container or Docker volume) is representable, and the
agent-sshd wait now targets the realizer's endpoint port (the container port
for Docker, port 22 for bare) instead of hard-coding the container port.

Selecting `isolation=NONE` is still accepted by config but currently raises
`BareIsolationNotYetSupportedError`. The realizer is fully implemented and
unit-tested (placement, store, discovery, listing), but the cloud wiring
remains: the bare idle-shutdown path (the aws/gcp/azure sentinel + systemd
poweroff watcher assumes the Docker volume layout and needs bare-awareness),
flipping the realizer selection, and rejecting Docker-only create inputs. So
bare is not yet runnable end-to-end. No user-visible behavior changes for
existing aws/gcp/azure/vultr/ovh/imbue_cloud providers.

Renamed the package from `mngr_vps_docker` to `mngr_vps` (the distribution
`imbue-mngr-vps-docker` to `imbue-mngr-vps`), since Docker is now one of two
placement shapes rather than the whole package. The shape-agnostic classes
dropped "Docker" from their names: `VpsDockerProvider` -> `VpsProvider`,
`VpsDockerProviderConfig` -> `VpsProviderConfig`, `MinimalVpsDockerProvider` ->
`MinimalVpsProvider`, `OfflineCapableVpsDockerProvider` ->
`OfflineCapableVpsProvider`, `TagMirrorVpsDockerProvider` ->
`TagMirrorVpsProvider`, `VpsDockerHostRecord` -> `VpsHostRecord`,
`VpsDockerHostStore` -> `VpsHostStore`, and the error base `VpsDockerError` ->
`VpsError`. The genuinely Docker-specific `DockerRealizer` and the
`container_setup` helpers keep their names. Mechanical rename; no behavior
change.
