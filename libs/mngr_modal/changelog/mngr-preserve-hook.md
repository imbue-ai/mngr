Offline hosts produced by this provider are now readable: the offline-host
construction path (used by both `get_host` for stopped hosts and
`to_offline_host`) returns an `OfflineHostWithVolume` (which implements the new
`HostFileReadInterface`) via the shared `make_readable_offline_host` helper.
This makes a stopped host's files readable through the same interface as an
online host -- used by Claude session preservation when a host is destroyed
while offline (the destroy path obtains the host via `get_host`), and available
to other readers of offline host data. The host's volume is resolved lazily on
first read, so this adds no per-host probe to host discovery. When no volume is
available, reads behave as "nothing there".

The new `get_volume_reference_for_host` is wrapped so missing/expired Modal
credentials surface as the user-friendly `ModalAuthError` (consistent with the
other provider methods) rather than a raw proxy error, including when reached
during offline-host construction.
