## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Changed: CI acceptance wall-clock cut ~62% — `mngr_modal` session-end leak detector reshaped (typed `ModalCleanupOutcome`, `pytest_sessionfinish` hook so it runs after all session-scoped fixture teardowns).

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr tmr --use-snapshot` modal launches additionally skip the per-agent initial filesystem snapshot.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr_modal` — `ModalMode.TESTING` removed from production paths (tests inject `TestingModalInterface` via `make_testing_provider`); `make_testing_provider` collapsed onto the shared `_construct_modal_provider` factory; `enable_output_capture` is now an abstract method on `ModalInterface`.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `mngr_modal` post-merge CI failure — restored the per-test reset of `ModalProviderBackend._app_registry` (load-bearing for cross-test isolation after the testing-factory reshape).
- Fixed: `mngr_modal` session env registered with the leak-detection registry so silent CLI cleanup failures are caught at session end; CLI cleanup helpers now surface non-zero exits as warnings.
