## mngr usage: per-session cost aggregation across recent sessions

`mngr usage` now aggregates cost **per session** within a recency window
instead of just rendering the freshest event's reading, and keeps
**subscription** and **API-key** spend in separate aggregates so imputed
estimates never get lumped with real billable spend:

- Reader scans every line of each agent's events file (not just the last),
  partitions each agent's events into Claude Code processes via cost-drop
  detection (cost is process-cumulative; `/clear` doesn't reset it), and
  within each process builds a `SessionCostRecord` per session whose `cost`
  is its delta from the prior session's cumulative reading.
- Each session is tagged with a `cost_mode`: `SUBSCRIPTION` if any event in
  its Claude Code process carried `rate_limits` (Claude.ai Pro/Max --
  cost is imputed by Claude Code, the user actually pays a flat subscription)
  or `API_KEY` otherwise (direct `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` -- cost is real
  billable spend).
- Sessions are filtered to those whose last event is within `--since`
  (default 24h, configurable per-invocation or via plugin config).
- Human output (default): one cost line per mode that contributed --
  `subscription cost (imputed): $X.YY ...` and/or `api cost: $X.YY ...`
  -- followed by the populated rate-limit window lines. Subscription is
  rendered first; either or both can be present.
- Human output with `--detail`: adds indented per-session lines (newest-first)
  between the cost lines and the window lines, each tagged `[sub]` or `[api]`.
- JSON output (default): `source.subscription_cost.*` and `source.api_cost.*`
  are the per-mode aggregates; `source.subscription_session_count`,
  `source.api_session_count`, and `source.session_count` (total) are also
  exposed. There is intentionally **no** combined `source.cost` field.
  `sessions[]` is omitted unless `--detail` is set.
- JSON output with `--detail`: adds `source.sessions[]` (newest-first
  records, each carrying `cost_mode`).
- `mngr usage wait --until` CEL surface: `subscription_cost.total_cost_usd`
  and `api_cost.total_cost_usd` are the per-mode aggregates; no combined
  `cost` field exists. To predicate on a specific session, index
  `sessions[]` directly. New `--since` flag affects the aggregates.
- Format template: top-level `{subscription_cost.*}` / `{api_cost.*}` keys;
  the format-template surface intentionally doesn't expose per-session
  paths (use `--format json` if you need them).

Examples:

```
mngr usage --since 7d                                # aggregate over 7 days
mngr usage wait --until 'api_cost.total_cost_usd > 20'  # real billable spend crossed $20
mngr usage wait --until 'subscription_cost.total_cost_usd > 50'  # imputed >$50 of value
mngr usage wait --until 'sessions[0].cost.total_cost_usd > 5'  # most recent session only
```

## 2026-05-12

- New `mngr usage` command (in a new `mngr_usage` plugin) reports Claude Code's rolling 5h / 7d / overage quota usage. Supports the same output ergonomics as `mngr list`: `--format human`/`json`/`jsonl`, `--format` template strings like `'5h:{five_hour.used_percentage}/7d:{seven_day.used_percentage}'`, and the same agent-filter flags (`--include`, `--exclude`, `--local`, `--provider`, `--project`, ...). The command is a pure reader -- it incurs no Anthropic API charges.
- `mngr usage` discovers events by enumerating agents via `list_agents` and reading each agent's `events/<source>/rate_limits/events.jsonl` via the events API. The writer side is wired up via a single `on_before_provisioning` hookimpl on mngr core, with no Claude-specific hookspec.
- `mngr usage` prints an actionable hint when no rate-limit events are present, explaining that the most likely cause is agents provisioned before the plugin was active and pointing users at provisioning a fresh agent or re-provisioning an existing one.

Add `mngr usage wait`: block until a usage snapshot matches a CEL
predicate, then exit 0. Useful for composing with `mngr message` / `mngr
create` to launch new work once budget conditions are met (e.g. "75% of
the 5h window has elapsed and at most 50% of the limit has been used"):

```
mngr usage wait --until 'five_hour.elapsed_percentage > 75 && five_hour.used_percentage < 50' \
  && mngr message my-agent "ok, kick off the next batch"
```

The CEL context per source matches `mngr usage --format json`'s
`sources[i]`. Exit codes mirror `mngr wait` (0 matched, 1 error, 2
timeout); JSONL output uses the same `state_change` envelope as
`mngr wait` so downstream consumers see one consistent shape across
both wait commands. Restrict matching to a specific writer with the
top-level `source` field in CEL (e.g. `source == "claude"`). Default
poll interval is 30s.

Internal: shared exit-code constants moved from `mngr_wait.primitives`
to `mngr.cli.exit_codes`, callable from both `mngr_wait` and
`mngr_usage`.
