## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added: New `azure` provider backend (`mngr_azure`) — runs mngr agents in Docker containers on Azure VMs, a thin adapter over the shared VPS-Docker base like the `aws` / `gcp` / `vultr` providers. Works with no config after `az login` (credentials via `DefaultAzureCredential`, subscription auto-resolved from config / `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` / the active `az` subscription). Defaults to Debian 12 on `Standard_B2s`; Azure build args take the `--azure-` prefix (`--azure-region=`, `--azure-vm-size=`, and `--azure-spot` for opt-in Spot capacity).
- Added: `mngr azure prepare` / `mngr azure cleanup` — one-time network setup (the mngr-owned resource group + vnet + subnet + NSG) and its safe, idempotent inverse, which refuses while any managed VM still exists. `prepare` opens SSH to `allowed_ssh_cidrs`, which defaults to a warned-open `0.0.0.0/0` like AWS/GCP (set `[]` to opt out; auth is key-only).
- Added: Leak-free resource handling — destroying an agent removes its VM and all associated resources together, and failed creates clean up after themselves; misconfiguration surfaces actionable guidance (set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, run `az login`, or run `mngr azure prepare`) instead of a generic failure.
- Added: `auto_shutdown_seconds` schedules an OS shutdown, but note Azure has no native delete-after-duration (unlike AWS/GCP) and still bills for a stopped-but-not-deallocated VM.
