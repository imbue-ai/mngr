Renamed the `_AGENT_TAG_FIELDS` constant imported from `mngr_vps` to the
public `AGENT_TAG_FIELDS` (matching its sibling `AGENT_TAG_PREFIX`), so the
Azure tag-mirror code no longer imports a private name across modules. No
behavior change.


Updated imports for the `mngr_vps_docker` -> `mngr_vps` package rename and the
accompanying class renames (`VpsDockerProvider` -> `VpsProvider`,
`VpsDockerProviderConfig` -> `VpsProviderConfig`, `VpsDockerHostRecord` ->
`VpsHostRecord`, `VpsDockerError` -> `VpsError`, etc.). Import-only; no behavior
change.


Enabled bare placement (`isolation=NONE`): an Azure OS shutdown does not halt
compute billing, so the bare agent's idle `shutdown.sh` runs the ARM
self-deallocate directly (the same call the container idle watcher uses), keeping
the self-deallocate role assignment and skipping the host-side sentinel watcher.
