## Provider gating: only `mngr create` may bootstrap host-creation state

`mngr list`, `mngr gc`, and other read flows no longer silently bootstrap
provider-side state just because a provider is enabled. Plumbed through a new
`is_for_host_creation: bool = False` parameter on
`ProviderBackendInterface.build_provider_instance` / `api.providers.get_provider_instance`,
which all backends accept and ignore by default. `mngr create` passes `True`;
every other path leaves the default. Providers that can't initialize without
their environment (e.g. Modal) now raise `ProviderUnavailableError`, which
higher-level loaders skip.
