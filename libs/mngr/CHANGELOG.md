## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added: New `Volume.path_exists(path)` method across all providers (local, Docker, Modal) and `ScopedVolume`.
- Added: `mngr extras config` subcommand walking user-scope config gaps (today: default agent type for `mngr create`).
- Added: `mngr plugin list --kind {agent-type,provider}` filter projecting to canonical agent-type or provider backend names.
- Added: urwid single-select picker for `mngr extras` Install/Skip prompts (completion, claude-plugin) and the default agent type step inside `mngr extras -i`.
- Added: New `UNKNOWN` value on `AgentLifecycleState` and `HostState`, defined as "the provider that owns this agent/host could not be accessed during the most recent discovery attempt." `AgentObserver` emits sticky UNKNOWN entries for previously-observed agents whose provider just failed.
- Added: `FullDiscoverySnapshotEvent` carries new `providers` and `error_by_provider_name` fields; `mngr observe --discovery-only` now emits a snapshot on every poll even when zero providers succeed.
- Added: `--restart` and `--no-resume` flags on `mngr start` for restarting a running agent and skipping the resume message.
- Added: New `HasTranscriptMixin` / `HasCommonTranscriptMixin` on `AgentInterface` formalising the raw-capture contract for `mngr transcript`.
- Added: `pre_baked_agent_id` field on `HostInterface` so `mngr create --reuse` honors the imbue_cloud lease-adopt scenario when the duplicate-name check would otherwise fire.
- Added: New `is_for_host_creation: bool = False` parameter on `ProviderBackendInterface.build_provider_instance` — only `mngr create` may bootstrap host-creation state; read flows leave the default.
- Added: `isolate_host_volumes` field on the Docker provider config — when `True`, each host container only sees its own per-host sub-folder of the shared state volume (via `--mount ... volume-subpath=...`, requires Docker Engine ≥25.0). Left unset, the provider emits a one-shot deprecation warning at startup noting the default will flip to `True` in a future release.
- Added: New top-level `allow_settings_key_assignment_narrowing` setting (default `false`) that raises `ConfigParseError` when a higher-precedence settings layer would assign over a non-empty list/tuple/dict/set value from a lower-precedence layer with anything that doesn't preserve every prior entry. The error tells the user how to opt in or use the `__extend` operator suffix for additive behavior on a specific key. The default is expected to flip to `true` in a future version.
- Added: `mngr config schema` lists every settable key with type and current effective value; `mngr config list --all` includes default-valued fields too; `mngr config extend KEY VALUE` writes the `__extend` form.
- Added: `TmuxSessionTarget` and `TmuxWindowTarget` Pydantic classes in `imbue.mngr.hosts.tmux` whose `.as_shell_arg()` renders the `-t` argument with a leading `=` (tmux's exact-match prefix), eliminating tmux's session-name prefix-matching fallback as a footgun.

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr list --format json` no longer emits the redundant `address` field; same value remains on parsed `AgentDetails.address` / `HostDetails.address`.
- Changed: Restored Modal compatibility for the standard mngr Dockerfile (single-stage `python:3.12-slim`); source-dependent setup moved to `scripts/post-source-setup.sh` and reused via offload's `post_patch_cmd`. Bumped offload pin from 0.9.2 to 0.9.5.
- Changed: `mngr create` no longer hard-codes `claude` as the default agent type — it must come from a positional argument, `--type`, or `[commands.create] type` in user settings; the error lists registered types and points at `mngr config set`.
- Changed: `scripts/install.sh` no longer carries custom shell logic for the default agent type — that prompt now runs inside `mngr extras -i` and is re-runnable via `mngr extras config`.
- Changed: Bumped pinned Claude Code CLI version from `2.1.116` to `2.1.141` in the Dockerfile.
- Changed: Renamed the mngr-side "workspace server" feature to "system interface"; HTTP endpoint `/api/agents/{id}/restart-workspace-server` → `/restart-system-interface` and SSE event `workspace_server_status` → `system_interface_status`.
- Changed: Renamed address-side `HostedLocation` → `HostLocationAddress` (with cascading renames to `parse_*`, `resolve_*`, `ResolvedHostedLocation`, `HostedLocationParamType`, `HOSTED_LOCATION` → `HOST_LOCATION_ADDRESS`, and the click param-type display name `host_location_address`).
- Changed: Unified agent-address resolution in single-agent subcommands — `push` / `pull` / `provision` / `rename` use `resolve_to_started_host_and_agent`; `connect` / `capture` use `resolve_to_started_host_and_running_agent`. `push` / `pull` / `provision` no longer require the agent to be running; all four gain a `--start/--no-start` flag.
- Changed: `mngr connect` no longer falls back to "most recently created agent" when run non-interactively without an explicit agent.
- Changed: `mngr list` no longer aborts with "Provider 'modal' is not available" when the Modal env hasn't been created yet — the listing pipeline silently skips providers raising `ProviderEmptyError`.
- Changed: `mngr list` no longer skips its side-effect snapshot when some providers failed; the snapshot now includes the per-provider error info.
- Changed: `ProviderError` now carries `provider_name` on the base class; every subclass requires it as the first constructor argument.
- Changed: `mngr rename` defaults to `--no-start` and works against offline hosts by writing into the provider's persisted agent data.
- Changed: `mngr create --provider lima` help text now shows `--memory=N` / `--disk=N` (plain integers).
- Changed: mngr's generated `~/.mngr/tmux.conf` widens `status-left-length` to 20 so a full `mngr-…` session name shows in the status bar.
- Changed: Discovery polling no longer retries failures at the top level — providers retry their own transient failures before raising.
- Changed (breaking): Unified settings overrides — `MNGR__X__Y__Z=value` env vars (note the double underscores) now target the dotted path `x.y.z`, replacing the narrow `MNGR_COMMANDS_<CMD>_<PARAM>` scheme; `--setting x.y.z=value` and `mngr config set x.y.z value` go through the same resolver. The `__extend` operator suffix on a leaf key (e.g. `cli_args__extend = [...]`) opts into additive behavior (append/key-merge/union); bare keys always assign.
- Changed (breaking): Layer merging is now assign-by-default for every aggregate (list, tuple, dict, set). Older configs that relied on implicit cross-scope concatenation of `cli_args`, etc. now need `field__extend = [...]` to keep additive behavior. The five top-level container dicts on `MngrConfig` (`agent_types`, `providers`, `plugins`, `commands`, `create_templates`) keep their per-key merge. Agent-type parent inheritance and create templates also stop auto-concatenating tuple options.
- Changed: CLI tuple/list flags (`--env`, `--label`, `--extra-window`, etc.) now extend the merged settings value rather than replace it — config-supplied entries come first, CLI-supplied values appended. Pipeline order is now `config_defaults → templates → CLI`.
- Changed: Renamed `gemini` agent type and `mngr_gemini` plugin to `antigravity` / `mngr_antigravity` to track Google's CLI rename. The plugin was never released, so this is a destructive rename with no shim.
- Changed: Regenerated `mngr latchkey` CLI doc reference; a new CI check now fails if any generated CLI doc drifts from `uv run python scripts/make_cli_docs.py` output.

### Removed

- Removed: `mngr provision` (aka `mngr prov`) subcommand and its docs; provisioning still runs automatically during `mngr create`.
- Removed: The agent-`permissions` concept from `mngr` core — `Permission`, `AgentPermissionsOptions`, `NoPermissionsAgentMixin`, `get_permissions`/`set_permissions`, the `--grant`/`--revoke` flags on `mngr limit`, and `--grant` on `mngr create` are gone. Higher-level libraries (latchkey, minds) keep their own permission concepts.
- Removed: The buggy `--on-error continue` flag the outer `mngr observe` was passing to its inner `mngr observe --discovery-only` child.
- Removed (breaking): `MNGR_COMMANDS_<CMD>_<PARAM>`, `MNGR_ENABLE_PARAMIKO_LOGGING`, and `MNGR_AGENT_READY_TIMEOUT` env vars (promoted to first-class config fields `logging.enable_paramiko_logging` and `agent_ready_timeout`, settable via `MNGR__*`). `MNGR_RETAIN_LOCK_FOR_FAILED_HOSTS_DURING_CREATE` renamed to `MNGR_DEBUG_RETAIN_LOCK_FOR_FAILED_HOSTS_DURING_CREATE`. `MNGR_ROOT_NAME`, `MNGR_HOST_DIR`, `MNGR_PREFIX`, and `MNGR_HEADLESS` aliases are preserved.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `tmux send-keys -l` and `tmux rename-session` now use the `--` end-of-options separator, so agent commands/messages and rename targets starting with `-` (e.g. `--model gemma`) are no longer misparsed by tmux.
- Fixed: `mngr create --type X` now fails fast with `UnknownAgentTypeError` when `X` doesn't resolve to a registered agent class, instead of silently resolving to a generic `BaseAgent`.
- Fixed: `Host._get_all_descendant_pids` no longer hits `RecursionError` on a PID-reuse cycle in the process tree, unsticking `host.stop_agents` on long-lived agents' cleanup paths.
- Fixed: `mngr config` help text and docs example use `--scope user` instead of the nonexistent `--user`.
- Fixed: tmux commands no longer silently misroute to the wrong agent's session under prefix collision (e.g. `gemini` vs `gemini-to-antigravity`). Every `-t` call site (lifecycle check, send-keys, paste-buffer, capture-pane, kill / rename / has-session, the post-attach resize script, and the TUI input pipeline) now routes through `TmuxSessionTarget` / `TmuxWindowTarget` so the rendered `-t` argument carries a leading `=` exact-match prefix.
- Fixed: Settings narrowing safety net — a brand-new `[create_templates.<name>]` block whose only `<opt>__extend = [...]` entry was introduced in a single layer no longer loses its `__extend` suffix at config-load time; and `agent_types.<name>.cli_args = "..."` (string form) no longer trips the narrowing guard when two layers each supply a string with different tokens.

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added: `mngr push` / `mngr pull` now accept the `@HOST[.PROVIDER]:PATH` syntax via the shared `HostedLocation` parser.

### Changed

- Changed: Address parsing refactored — typed `HostAddress` / `AgentAddress` / `NewAgentLocation` / `HostedLocation` parsed once at the Click boundary and threaded through the API layer; `HostName` no longer permits dots; many `parse_*` helpers and `api/agent_addr.py` deleted.
- Changed: `mngr create` — positional `AGENT_TYPE` now wins over a config-supplied `type`; `--type` defaults to `"claude"` and `--start-on-boot` to `False` directly (rather than resolved at runtime).
- Changed: `mngr.toml` unknown-field errors for `[agent_types.<name>]` now include a missing-plugin hint and list currently disabled plugins.
- Changed: `cel-python` minimum bumped to `>=0.5.0` to match the global `mngr` install and surface strict-typo warnings reliably.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `mngr list` / `mngr kanpan` no longer log per-agent CEL warnings for `--include` / `--exclude` filters that reference keys on tolerant schemaless fields (`labels`, `plugin`, `host.tags`, `host.plugin`); typos against strict fields still warn.
- Fixed: `mngr clone <agent> <new-name>@.<provider>` (and `mngr migrate` cross-host moves) now succeeds — plugin-state rsync runs on the source agent's host so the Claude transcript / session history / memory carries over.
- Fixed: `mngr create` defaults — encoded the real defaults for options that previously listed a help-text default but were stored as `None` and resolved at runtime, and corrected `--worktree-base-folder` help.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added: `DockerBuildTimeoutError` raised (with config-knob hint) when `docker build` exceeds the per-provider `build_timeout_seconds`.
- Added: `mngr create -vv` emits a `Transferring agent files` log span (with `count=0` for the no-transfer path) around the per-file `write_file` loop.
- Added: New `MalformedJsonlLineError` (`imbue.mngr.errors`).

### Changed

- Changed: Default `docker build` timeout bumped from 5 to 10 minutes; configurable per provider via `build_timeout_seconds`.
- Changed: JSONL parsers (`MalformedJsonLineWarner.parse`, `parse_event_line`, `parse_discovery_event_line`, `parse_agents_from_mngr_output`, vps_docker's `_parse_batched_json_files`) now raise on malformed input instead of silently returning `None`.
- Changed: `mngr` accepts `host.provider` qualifier consistently anywhere a host identifier is taken (e.g. `mngr create --from @m1.modal:/path`, `mngr limit --host m1.modal`, `mngr snapshot create --host m1.modal`).
- Changed: Default transfer mode for same-host remote git sources is now `git-worktree` instead of `git-mirror`; same-host `--from` short-circuits to a single in-host `git push` / local rsync.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `mngr stop` no longer leaves orphaned grandchildren (e.g. `playwright-mcp`, `node`) alive on Linux when an agent's pane process was killed abruptly; `Host.stop_agents` now also enumerates processes by inherited `MNGR_AGENT_ID` via `/proc/<pid>/environ`.
- Fixed: `mngr message <agent> -m /clear` (and `/compact`) no longer hangs for 90 s — the `mngr-submit-<session>` tmux signal is now also fired from the SessionStart hook for `clear` / `compact` sources.
- Fixed: `mngr gc` no longer crashes on hosts whose SSH host key is missing from `known_hosts`; raises `HostAuthenticationError` (a trust failure) instead of generic `HostConnectionError`.
- Fixed: Spurious "Duplicate host name '127.0.0.1' found on provider 'docker'" warning on `mngr list` when multiple Docker containers run against a local daemon — `Host.get_name()` now returns the mngr-assigned host name; use `get_connector_host_name()` for the connector address.
- Fixed: `mngr plugin add` no longer warns about unknown config fields and unknown provider backends when the local config references plugins that haven't been installed yet.
- Fixed: `mngr create --from` against a remote source now works for any provider (the git-author / origin-URL lookups now route through the host interface); same-host `--transfer=git-worktree` is allowed.
- Fixed: `mngr create` now provisions credentials correctly inside nested sandboxes (e.g. Linux lima VM on macOS host) — `get_user_claude_config_dir()` falls back to `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when `$ORIGINAL_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` doesn't exist inside the VM.
- Fixed: One-event lag in remote (online-host) `events.jsonl` follow-mode tailing — the remote read now wraps `cat` with a sentinel so an absent trailing newline is detectable.
- Fixed: Local-host shell commands issued from worker threads no longer crash on Linux with `TypeError: child watchers are only available on the default loop` — `Host._run_shell_command` bypasses pyinfra's gevent `LocalConnector` for local hosts.
- Fixed: `resolve_provider_names_for_identifiers` no longer silently returns partial results when an identifier is unknown — returns `None` to signal a full discovery scan.
