Minds dev-environment fixes:

- Hard-enforces the `dev-<your-user>` naming convention for dev envs:
  `DevEnvName` rejects anything that does not start with `dev-`, and
  `MINDS_ROOT_NAME_PATTERN` only accepts `minds`, `minds-staging`, or
  `minds-dev-<rest>`. Dev env roots come out tier-first as
  `~/.minds-dev-<your-user>/` and `MINDS_ROOT_NAME=minds-dev-<your-user>`.
- `minds env activate` now exports `MODAL_PROFILE` derived from the
  activated tier's committed `modal_workspace`. Every subsequent
  `modal` CLI shellout (deploy, secret create, environment create) is
  pinned to the right workspace regardless of which profile is marked
  `active = true` in `~/.modal.toml`. Prerequisite: the operator must
  have a matching profile in `~/.modal.toml` for each tier
  (`modal token set --profile <workspace>` once per tier). Skipped
  when the tier's `modal_workspace` is still the literal `CHANGE_ME`
  placeholder.
- Renamed `vps_ip` -> `vps_address` end-to-end: API models
  (`LeaseResult`, `LeasedHostInfo`, `LeaseHostResponse`), all Python
  call sites, AND the `pool_hosts.vps_ip` DB column. Migration ships
  as `apps/remote_service_connector/migrations/003_vps_address.sql`
  (idempotent rename). The field can hold a public IPv4 or a DNS
  hostname (e.g. OVH's `vps-eec8860b.vps.ovh.us`).
- `min_containers` for the deployed `remote-service-connector-<tier>`
  and `litellm-proxy-<tier>` Modal apps is now driven by a tier's
  committed `deploy.toml` via a new `[min_containers]` block (fields:
  `connector`, `litellm_proxy`). Defaults to 0 in the Pydantic model;
  staging / production deploy.toml ship with `1` for both. The values
  thread into `modal deploy` as `MINDS_CONNECTOR_MIN_CONTAINERS` /
  `MINDS_LITELLM_PROXY_MIN_CONTAINERS`, which the modal app modules
  read at import time.
- Per-dev-env Neon **project** (not just a database): each dev env
  now owns a brand-new Neon project named `minds-<env>` under the
  dev-tier Neon org, containing two databases (`host_pool` and
  `litellm_cost`). `minds env deploy` provisions the project and
  applies the `pool_hosts` schema (via `apps/remote_service_connector/
  migrations/*.sql`) to `host_pool` automatically. `minds env destroy`
  deletes the project outright -- atomic teardown of both DBs, roles,
  and the project's pooler endpoint.

  The deploy now overrides BOTH `neon.DATABASE_URL` and
  `litellm.DATABASE_URL` in the per-env Modal Secrets with the per-env
  project's two DSNs, so the connector and the LiteLLM proxy talk to
  the same env-isolated Neon project. The per-env `secrets.toml` on
  disk grows two fields (`NEON_HOST_POOL_DSN`, `NEON_LITELLM_DSN`,
  replacing the single `NEON_POOLED_DSN`).

  Vault `secrets/minds/<tier>/neon-admin` now expects `NEON_ORG_ID`
  (instead of `NEON_PROJECT_ID`). The token must have project-create
  scope on the dev tier's Neon org.

  `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` and friends now auto-resolve
  `--database-url` from the activated minds env's `NEON_HOST_POOL_DSN`
  (or `MINDS_HOST_POOL_DSN` env var), so the standard dev-env flow no
  longer requires passing the DSN explicitly. Operators outside an
  activated env still pass `--database-url` directly.

  Staging / production keep the tier-shared single-DB model unchanged.

- Added a `secrets/minds/<tier>/ovh` Vault template (AK / AS / CK) and
  documented the manual provisioning step in
  `apps/minds/docs/vault-setup.md` and
  `apps/minds/docs/host-pool-setup.md`.

- `minds env deploy` is now actually idempotent against Neon. The
  Neon REST API does not 409 on duplicate project names within an
  organization -- POSTing `/projects` with a name that's already in
  use creates a second, distinct project with the same name and a
  different id. The previous `create_neon_project` assumed Neon would
  409 (the adopt-fallback path was never reached), so every dev-tier
  re-deploy silently leaked an entire Neon project (with its own
  host_pool + litellm_cost DBs + branches + endpoints). Several
  attempts at deploying dev-josh-1 during one session today left
  four projects named `minds-dev-josh-1` in the dev org. The same
  bug would have caused `minds env destroy` to delete the wrong
  project (always the first match from the list endpoint, i.e. the
  oldest, not the live one), leaving the live project stranded.
  `create_neon_project` and `delete_neon_project` now look up by
  name first via `_find_projects_by_name`, adopt when there's
  exactly one match, raise a `NeonProviderError` with every
  matching project id + creation timestamp + a copy-pasteable
  cleanup recipe when there are several. Refusing-loud is
  intentional: silently picking one would risk destroying the wrong
  project under a real name collision (e.g. two devs using the same
  env name cross-machine). A new `_select_one_or_raise_multi_match`
  pure helper carries the decision logic; the operator-facing error
  message is unit-tested.

- Connector auth endpoints no longer 500 on `/auth/session/revoke`,
  `/auth/email/is-verified`, `/auth/email/send-verification`. The connector's
  twelve `async def` endpoints (plus the `_build_session_tokens` helper)
  have been converted to sync `def`, with the SuperTokens recipe imports
  switched from their `asyncio` modules to the `syncio` equivalents. The
  three broken endpoints were calling SuperTokens' `syncio.get_user` /
  `syncio.get_session_without_request_response` from inside an
  `async def`, where the syncio wrapper's `loop.run_until_complete` hit
  "RuntimeError: This event loop is already running" against the live
  FastAPI/uvicorn loop and produced bare 500s. The conversion makes the
  bug class structurally impossible (no event loop is running in
  FastAPI's threadpool workers) and also aligns the file with the
  monorepo style guide's prohibition on `async`/`asyncio`. Each
  newly-sync endpoint is wrapped in `with handle_endpoint_errors():` so
  error handling stays uniform across the file. The two OAuth callback
  endpoints still need to bridge to async-only methods on SuperTokens'
  `Provider` object (`get_authorisation_redirect_url`,
  `exchange_auth_code_for_oauth_tokens`, `get_user_info`); those three
  calls go through `supertokens_python.async_to_sync_wrapper.sync`, the
  same wrapper SuperTokens' own syncio modules use internally -- safe
  here because FastAPI runs sync def endpoints in a threadpool worker
  with no live event loop.

- `mngr list` no longer aborts with "Provider 'modal' is not available"
  when the Modal per-user environment hasn't been created yet. The
  Modal backend now raises a new `ProviderEmptyError` (distinct from
  `ProviderUnavailableError`) when its env doesn't exist, and the
  listing pipeline silently skips empty providers in every mode
  (streaming + batch, ABORT + CONTINUE). Semantically: empty means
  "the backend answered that there's nothing here" and is always safe
  to drop from a listing; unavailable means "we couldn't ask" and may
  still warrant an error.

Minds deploy safety overhaul (spec
`specs/minds-deploy-safety-overhaul/spec.md`):

- Shorter Modal app + function names so the deployed hostname stays
  under DNS's 63-char limit for every realistic env name:
  `remote-service-connector` -> `rsc`, `fastapi_app` -> `api`,
  `litellm-proxy` -> `llm`, `litellm_app` -> `proxy`. Modal workspaces
  rename to `minds-dev` / `minds-staging` / `minds-production`. URL
  is now exactly what we compute up front, so the deploy no longer
  runs a second-pass secret push or a connector redeploy. `DevEnvName`
  enforces a 40-char max so the hostname budget always fits.

- One `minds env deploy` path for every tier, driven by a new required
  `[lifecycle]` block in each tier's `deploy.toml` (flags:
  `creates_resources`, `modal_env_strategy`, `writes_local_state`,
  `tracks_generation`). dev / staging / production all execute the
  same code now; behavior diverges only via the flag matrix.
  `deploy_dev_env` + `deploy_tier_env` collapse into `deploy_env`.
  Inline best-effort rollback machinery (`_best_effort_rollback`,
  `_ROLLBACK_TABLE`, `_rollback_*`) deleted -- replaced by
  `minds env recover` (below). Production now `tracks_generation=true`
  for parity with staging (production destroy is hard-refused so the
  generation id is effectively immutable for the tier's lifetime).

- Pool-hosts schema migrations now backed by a real
  `schema_migrations(version, applied_at)` table instead of the old
  "replay every .sql with IF NOT EXISTS guards". New
  `apps/minds/imbue/minds/envs/migrations.py` owns the runner. Legacy
  files keep their `IF NOT EXISTS` guards so a backfill against an
  already-migrated DB is a no-op + records the row; new migrations
  land WITHOUT guards (the table is the source of truth).

- Every `minds env deploy` mints a fresh `MINDS_DEPLOY_ID` (UTC
  `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`) and pushes every Modal Secret under a new name
  `<svc>-<tier>-<deploy_id>` (no overwrites). The deployed Modal apps
  read `MINDS_DEPLOY_ID` at module load and pin every
  `Secret.from_name(...)` to the matching timestamped name. Hard-fails
  at module load if `MINDS_DEPLOY_ID` is missing (no fallback to
  unsuffixed names; manual `modal deploy` outside `minds env deploy`
  is unsupported). End-of-deploy GC keeps the last 10 timestamped
  secrets per `<svc>-<tier>`; shared-tier destroy deletes all
  timestamped secrets matching the tier.

- New `minds env recover` command + recover-target file at the
  monorepo root. Every deploy captures pre-deploy Modal app versions,
  creates a Neon snapshot branch (`pre-deploy-<deploy_id>` off the
  default branch -- COW so it's near-free), and writes
  `.minds-deploy-recover-target.json` (gitignored) atomically BEFORE
  touching any external state. On a failed deploy, the operator runs
  `minds env recover`; it idempotently runs every reversal step
  (`modal app rollback`, Neon branch-restore from the snapshot with
  the pre-restore state preserved under `pre-rollback-<deploy_id>`,
  delete orphan timestamped secrets, delete the recover-target file).
  Successful deploys delete the snapshot branch (best-effort cleanup).
  Every other `minds env *` command (`activate` / `deactivate` /
  `list` / `deploy` / `destroy`) refuses to run while a recover-
  target file exists.

  Snapshot/restore works for every tier (dev creates_resources=true
  and shared creates_resources=false). Shared tiers (staging /
  production) require `NEON_PROJECT_ID` in their
  `secrets/minds/<tier>/neon-admin` Vault entry; the deploy resolves
  the default branch on demand. Without `NEON_PROJECT_ID` shared-tier
  deploys log a warning and skip the snapshot (so recover can roll
  back Modal apps but not the DB).

- Post-deploy health check: `await_apps_healthy` polls
  `<connector>/docs` and `<litellm_proxy>/health` for up to 30s each
  (sequential), with cold-boot 5xx tolerance + immediate failure on
  4xx / 5xx-with-body / wrong-shape responses. Failure surfaces as
  `HealthCheckFailedError` and goes through the same "run
  `minds env recover`" guidance as any other deploy failure.

- Each deploy also gets a `[lifecycle].tracks_generation=true` tier
  generation id minted into the litellm-connector Modal Secret (no
  change for dev / staging; production now also gets one).

Operator-visible: re-deploys after any of the above are
backwards-compatible against the existing dev-tier resources. The
shared (`staging` / `production`) tiers' `deploy.toml` files now
require a `[lifecycle]` block; operators bringing up staging /
production for the first time need to populate the existing OAuth
client IDs as before plus ensure the `[lifecycle]` block matches the
defaults documented in the committed file.
