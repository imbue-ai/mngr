- minds now injects `LATCHKEY_DISABLE_COUNTING=1` into every workspace
  whenever latchkey is wired (alongside `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY`,
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`, and `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE`).
  The workspace-side `latchkey` CLI runs in client mode against the
  host-side gateway, so suppressing its daily goatcounter.com ping
  prevents every agent from being counted as a separate active user --
  the single host-side gateway already represents the one real user.
