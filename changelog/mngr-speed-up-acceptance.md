CI acceptance test speedups, two changes:

1. Grant `contents: write` to the `test-offload` and `test-offload-acceptance` jobs so offload can push its image-cache git notes back to `refs/notes/offload-images`. Previously every run was a cache miss (the `git push` from offload failed with "Permission to imbue-ai/mngr.git denied to github-actions[bot]"), forcing a full `checkpoint_base_prepare` rebuild (~150 s wasted per CI run on acceptance, similar on the regular offload job). Measured saving on cache hit: ~124 s per acceptance run.

2. Lower `max_parallel` from 200 to 50 in `offload-modal-acceptance.toml`. With 200 slots and ~94 tests, offload's LPT scheduler degenerated to one-test-per-batch, so every batch paid full pytest cold-start, Modal sandbox creation, and an orchestrator-side `uv run` cold-start per download. Lowering to 50 lets LPT pack ~2-4 tests per batch (longest single tests still alone via load-balancing). Combined measured saving: ~62% acceptance wall-clock reduction.
