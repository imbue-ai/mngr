- Fixed a perpetual one-event lag in remote (online-host) event
  follow-mode tailing. When reading `events.jsonl` over the wire,
  pyinfra's `CommandOutput.stdout` is built by `"\n".join(...)` after
  each line is `rstrip("\n")`-ed, so a file ending in `\n` and one not
  ending in `\n` produced identical strings. The follow loop's
  partial-write guard then treated the most recent complete line as
  in-flight and held it back until a later line forced it out. The
  remote read now wraps `cat` as `{ cat <file> && printf '%s' <sentinel>; }`,
  asserts the sentinel is present, and strips it back off to recover
  the file's exact byte tail.
