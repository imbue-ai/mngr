Accept the `host.provider` qualifier consistently anywhere mngr takes a host
identifier (previously only the positional `agent@host.provider` form worked).
For example, `mngr create --from @m1.modal:/some/path`, `mngr limit --host
m1.modal`, `mngr snapshot create --host m1.modal`, and the `--host` filter on
list-style commands now all resolve `host.provider` deterministically.

Also fix `mngr create --from` against a remote source: the current-branch
lookup, and the related git-author/origin-URL lookups in remote-source flows,
now run through the host interface so they work for any provider rather than
raising `NotImplementedError`.

`mngr create --from` between a source and a target on the same remote host
now works: the git-mirror push short-circuits to a single in-host `git push`
between two local paths (no SSH), and `--transfer=git-worktree` is allowed
whenever source and target are on the same host -- previously it was
restricted to local-only agents. The default transfer mode for same-host
remote git sources is now `git-worktree` instead of `git-mirror`.
