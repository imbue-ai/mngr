- Bumped the `latchkey` npm dependency to 2.8.0 and switched minds to
  running a single shared `latchkey gateway` subprocess for every agent
  instead of one per agent. The gateway is now password-protected via
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_LISTEN_PASSWORD` (the password is derived
  deterministically from the desktop client's Latchkey encryption key by
  hashing a JWT minted with `latchkey gateway create-jwt`, so it
  survives restarts without being persisted in plaintext).
- Each agent gets its own `latchkey_permissions.json`. At
  agent-creation time minds allocates an opaque
  `~/.minds/latchkey/permissions/<uuid>.json` handle, materializes it
  with empty rules (deny-all baseline), mints a permissions-override
  JWT for that path, and injects all three latchkey env vars
  (`LATCHKEY_GATEWAY`, `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`,
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE`) at `mngr create` time.
  After `mngr create` returns the canonical agent id, minds replaces
  the opaque file with a symlink pointing at the canonical
  `~/.minds/agents/<agent_id>/latchkey_permissions.json` location, so
  the existing permission-grant flow continues to write to its
  conventional path while the gateway reads through the symlink. The
  gateway's own default permissions config
  (`~/.minds/latchkey_default_permissions.json`) is materialized empty
  (deny-all) so requests that bypass the JWT mechanism cannot reach
  any service.
- DEV-mode agents (which run in-process on the bare host with no SSH
  reverse tunnel) now go through the same gateway as every other
  launch mode. `AgentCreator` queries the gateway's live host port
  and injects it as `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY=http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic_port>`
  alongside the password and JWT. Previously DEV agents bypassed the
  gateway entirely, which made the full latchkey flow impossible to
  exercise from DEV.
- The agent-side `latchkey` CLI version is pinned in
  `forever-claude-template`'s Dockerfile (`ARG LATCHKEY_VERSION=…`) and
  must be bumped to 2.8.0 in lockstep with this change. Agents booting
  from an image that pre-dates the bump will hit `401` on every gateway
  call because their `latchkey` CLI doesn't know about the new password
  and override headers.
- Old per-agent gateway records left under
  `~/.minds/agents/<id>/latchkey_gateway.json` are cleaned up
  automatically on desktop-client startup. Agents that were created
  with earlier minds versions need to be re-created to pick up the new
  env vars; without them their `latchkey` CLI calls will be rejected by
  the now-password-protected gateway.
