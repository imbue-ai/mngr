- The `permission-requests` latchkey gateway extension now expects POST
  bodies with the fields `agent_id`, `scope` (string), `permissions`
  (list of strings), and `rationale` in place of the previous
  `service_name` field. Pending requests are stored under
  `<latchkey-directory>/permission_requests/v1/` so any existing files
  left over from the old shape are silently ignored.
- The `permissions` latchkey gateway extension now exposes two new
  catalog endpoints: `GET /permissions/available` returns the full
  catalog as a JSON object keyed by raw service name, and
  `GET /permissions/available/<service_name>` returns a single entry
  (or 404 if the service is unknown). Each catalog value has the
  shape `{"scope": "<schema_name>", "display_name": "...",
  "permissions": [...]}`. The catalog is backed by a `services.json`
  data file that ships alongside the extensions and is materialized
  into `LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY/extensions/` together with the `.mjs` files
  at gateway-spawn time.
