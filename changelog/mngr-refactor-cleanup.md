Cleanup pass after splitting functionality out of minds into the `mngr_imbue_cloud` and `mngr_forward` plugins.

- The "Share" button in a workspace now opens a static informational modal that points the user at the desktop app, rather than writing a sharing-request event back to minds. Direct sharing editing from the desktop client (workspace settings page) is unchanged. Permissions / latchkey request flows are unchanged.
- Minds no longer persists `imbue_cloud` account identity (email, display_name) to disk. Only the workspace<->account association map lives in `~/.minds/workspace_associations.json`; identity is sourced on demand from the new `mngr imbue_cloud auth list` command and cached in memory.
- Destroyed agents now disappear from the projects index automatically without requiring the user to click into the destroying detail page first.
