TMR: when running against a remote provider with `--use-snapshot` (or
`--snapshot=<id>`), avoid re-uploading the code repo for every test agent.
The snapshotter agent's work_dir is now pinned to `/code` on its host, and
each test agent created from the resulting snapshot sources from that
on-host `/code` via `git-worktree` -- previously each agent re-pushed the
git history from the laptop.
