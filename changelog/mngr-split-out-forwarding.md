# mngr_forward plugin

A new `mngr_forward` plugin (in `libs/mngr_forward/`) lands the auth +
subdomain-forwarding logic that used to live inside the minds desktop
client. The plugin runs as a standalone tool:

```bash
mngr plugin enable forward
mngr forward --service system_interface
```

What you get:

- Local proxy on `127.0.0.1:8421` that serves
  `<agent-id>.localhost:8421/*` and byte-forwards each HTTP and WebSocket
  request to the agent's `system_interface` URL via SSH tunnels for
  remote agents.
- One-time login URL printed to stderr (or emitted as a JSONL `login_url`
  event in `--format jsonl`); the resulting cookie is signed with a key
  persisted under `$MNGR_HOST_DIR/plugin/forward/` so browser sessions
  survive plugin restarts.
- `--reverse <remote-port>:<local-port>` (repeatable) sets up reverse SSH
  tunnels for every discovered remote agent. `<remote-port>` may be `0`
  for sshd-assigned ports; the actual bound port is reported via a
  `forward.reverse_tunnel_established` envelope event.
- `--no-observe --forward-port REMOTE_PORT` mode runs `mngr list` once
  and forwards a fixed snapshot. `--no-observe --service NAME` is rejected
  as a CLI usage error.
- `--agent-include` / `--agent-exclude` / `--event-include` /
  `--event-exclude` CEL filters control which agents and event sources
  the plugin tracks.
- `SIGHUP` bounces only the `mngr observe` child subprocess; SSH tunnels,
  per-agent event subprocesses, browser sessions, and the FastAPI app
  stay alive — used by `minds run` to make a freshly-written
  `[providers.imbue_cloud_<slug>]` block in `settings.toml` take effect.

# minds run

A new `minds run` command rewires the minds desktop client to spawn
`mngr forward` as a subprocess instead of running the same forwarding
logic in-process:

```bash
minds run --port 8420 --mngr-forward-port 8421
```

- Spawns `mngr forward --service system_interface --preauth-cookie ...`
  and consumes its envelope JSONL stream on stdout.
- Serves the slimmed minds bare-origin UI on `--port` (default 8420);
  agent subdomains are served by the spawned `mngr forward` on
  `--mngr-forward-port` (default 8421).
- Emits a `mngr_forward_started` JSONL event on stdout carrying the
  preauth cookie value so the Electron shell can pre-set
  `mngr_forward_session=<value>` on `localhost:<mngr-forward-port>`
  before the first agent-subdomain navigation.
- Sends `SIGHUP` to the plugin's PID after a freshly-written
  `[providers.imbue_cloud_<slug>]` block in `settings.toml` so the new
  provider becomes visible without restarting the plugin.

The legacy `minds forward` command and its in-process forwarding /
auth / subdomain code are intentionally unchanged in this branch and
keep working. A follow-up branch will delete the now-duplicated
in-process paths.
